# Introduction to Computer Vision
This repository contains notebooks for learning about how convolutional neural networks (CNN's) can be used to create an image classifier given a set of training data. The notebooks include examples that are meant for learning about the individual layers that make up a convolutional neural network, and an example clothing classifier that is trained on the [FashionMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset.
